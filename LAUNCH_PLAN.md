# PR Pilot — Launch Content & Marketing Plan

## X/Twitter Launch Thread (5 tweets)

**Tweet 1 (Hook):**
> I built a code review service where 5 AI agents handle the entire pipeline — from bug detection to patch generation to merge decisions. No humans in the loop.
>
> Here's what happens when you open a PR: 🧵

**Tweet 2 (The Pipeline):**
> Agent 1 — Reviewer: Analyzes diff for bugs, security issues, perf regressions
> Agent 2 — Fixer: Generates code patches for every issue
> Agent 3 — Tester: Writes unit tests for changed code
> Agent 4 — Verifier: Confirms no regressions, all tests pass
> Agent 5 — Escalator: Auto-approves safe changes, escalates only the hard ones
>
> Full pipeline: ~90 seconds.

**Tweet 3 (The Value Prop):**
> Small dev teams can't afford dedicated code review. PR Pilot gives you enterprise-grade quality for $99/mo.
>
> It catches real bugs. Here's one from a recent review: SQL injection via raw f-strings in a delete_user() handler. Agent generated the parameterized query fix before a human even saw the PR.

**Tweet 4 (Why It Matters):**
> This is built for the Build with Gemini XPRIZE — the business IS the agent chain. Every review, every fix, every decision is made by AI agents.
>
> 90%+ of reviews are fully autonomous. Humans only step in for the genuinely hard calls.

**Tweet 5 (CTA):**
> Try the live emulator on the landing page — watch the full 5-agent pipeline run in your browser:

## Hacker News "Show HN" Post

**Title:** Show HN: PR Pilot — 5 AI agents autonomously review, fix, and approve pull requests

**Body:**

PR Pilot is an AI-native code quality service I built for the Build with Gemini XPRIZE. The core idea: what if the entire code review pipeline ran without humans?

When you open a PR, five autonomous agents fire in sequence:

1. **Reviewer** — analyzes every changed file for bugs, security issues, and performance regressions
2. **Fixer** — generates minimal, correct code patches
3. **Tester** — detects your test framework and writes unit tests for changed code
4. **Verifier** — validates fixes, confirms no regressions
5. **Escalator** — makes the call: auto-approve, request changes, or escalate to a human

The whole chain completes in ~90 seconds. 90%+ of reviews are handled autonomously.

I'm dogfooding it on its own repo — every PR gets reviewed by the agents. The GitHub Actions workflow is open-source (MIT), so you can self-host. The managed service is $49-199/mo with a 14-day free trial.

Built with Gemini API (required for the XPRIZE), Cloud Run, and FastAPI.

There's a live emulator on the landing page where you can watch the agent chain process common vulnerabilities (SQL injection, blocking sleep, nested imports):

Happy to answer questions about the architecture, agent decision logic, or anything else.
